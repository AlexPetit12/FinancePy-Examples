# FinancePy-Examples

FinancePy is a python-based library that is currently in beta version. It covers the following functionality:

* Valuation and risk models for a wide range of equity, FX, interest rate and credit derivatives.

Although it is written entirely in Python, it can achieve speeds comparable to C++ by using Numba. As a result the user has both the ability to examine the underlying code and the ability to perform pricing and risk at speeds which compare to a library written in C++.

This repository is the library of example notebooks that you can download and use to get started using FinancePy.

It is not the source library for FinancePy. That can be found at:

I will be adding to this library so you may wish to return here periodically if you wish to use FinancePy.

To provide comments, report bugs or send suggestions for notebooks, contact me at allmypythonprojects@gmail.com.

You can also, if you wish, send me notebooks (or submit it via a pull request) that you have created which I can add to the repository.
